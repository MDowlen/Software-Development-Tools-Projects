This project  provides a demonstration of  common software engineering tasks that tasks will augment and complement data analysis 


Purpose of the Checkboxes:

The two checkboxes allow users to interactively control which charts are displayed in the Streamlit app. This enhances user engagement and exploration of the car data by providing options to view:

Car Type Popularity: When checked, this displays a bar chart showing the count of listings for each car type, giving insights into the most prevalent car types in the dataset.
Average Price by Car Type: When checked, this displays a bar chart depicting the average price for each car type, facilitating comparisons and identifying potential trends in pricing across different types.

Benefits of Interactive Filtering:

User control: Users can choose which information they want to see, tailoring the analysis to their specific interests.
Flexibility: This allows for exploring different aspects of the data without cluttering the app with multiple charts simultaneously.
Customization: Users can quickly switch between viewing popularity and price information, enabling an interactive data exploration experience.
